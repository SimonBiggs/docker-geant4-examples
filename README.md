Run this by calling:

    docker run -p 8888:8888 simonbiggs/geant4-examples

Then type either `localhost:8888` (linux) or `192.168.59.103:8888` (windows or mac) into a chrome or firefox browser.


[An example of what this docker image lets you do](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SimonBiggs/ipython-geant4-linac/blob/master/main.ipynb). [More detailed install instructions](https://github.com/SimonBiggs/ipython-geant4-linac/blob/master/README.md#ipython-geant4-linac).

If you have any trouble getting this to work first try running `docker pull simonbiggs/geant4-examples` just in case I have released an update fixing your problem. If you are still having trouble then feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail@simonbiggs.net) I am more than happy to help.
